## Target Practice

[Live site](https://djpo.github.io/targetpractice)

Target Practice is a space age skeet shooter that tests your pattern recognition and concentration. It was inspired by a game I played many years ago on a text-based, role-playing MUD in the Ender's Game universe.

This project was created during General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. The challenge was to create a game with only web fundamentals: JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS.
